## Neural net's basic constituents
**Building blocks**
1. Computational graph for forward prop (operation: common arithmetic operations, operand: data, gradient tracking)
2. Backward prop & backward sequence logic (local derivative + chain rule, topological sort)

**Adhesive**
1. Neuron
2. Layer
3. Multi Layer Perceptron
4. Loss function
5. Optimization on parameters 
6. Zero-grad

**Supplementary**
1. Learning rate
2. Regularizer

Can we elevate this simple idea to:
1. Regression?
2. Classification? - Binary âœ…
3. Image classification?
4. Object Detection?
5. Semantic Segmentation?
6. Text classification?
7. Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
8. Reinforcement Learning?
9. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)?
10. Time Series Analysis?
11. Anomaly Detection?
12. Recommendation Systems?
13. Data imputation?
14. Dimensionality Reduction?
15. Face Recognition?
